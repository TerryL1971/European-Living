# Aachen — Where Charlemagne Built Europe

*Your insider's guide to the cradle of European civilization*

---

Stand in Aachen's Marktplatz and you're standing at the crossroads of European history.

This unassuming city of 250,000 near Germany's western border was once the **capital of Charlemagne's empire** — the heart of medieval Europe. Kings and emperors were crowned here for 600 years. The cathedral you see rising above the square is over 1,200 years old and houses Charlemagne's throne. The town hall sits on the ruins of his palace.

But here's what makes Aachen special: it's not a museum city frozen in time. It's a **living, breathing college town** with 45,000 students from RWTH Aachen University giving it youthful energy. It's a **thermal spa city** where Romans bathed 2,000 years ago and locals still soak today. It's an **international crossroads** where Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands meet — you can stand at the tri-border point and touch three countries at once.

Aachen is **quiet** compared to Berlin's chaos or Cologne's tourist buzz. It's **walkable** — you can see everything in a day or luxuriate for a weekend. It's **historic** in a way that feels tangible, not performative. And it's **underrated** — most tourists skip it entirely, which is honestly their loss.

The thermal springs still steam. The students still party. The cathedral still awes. And Charlemagne's legacy still echoes through every cobblestone street.

Here's everything you need to know about the city they call the "cradle of Europe."

## ✨ The Aachen Moments That'll Stay With You

**Standing Before Charlemagne's Throne**
You climb the narrow stairs in the cathedral gallery and there it is — the simple marble throne where Charlemagne sat 1,200 years ago. Thirty Holy Roman Emperors were crowned on this throne. You can't sit on it, but you can stand next to it. The weight of history is overwhelming.

**The Cathedral Treasury Blowing Your Mind**
Gold. Jewels. Relics. The most incredible collection of medieval religious treasures you'll ever see. Charlemagne's bust studded with gems. The arm reliquary that allegedly held John the Baptist's forearm. Objects that have survived wars, fires, and centuries. The cathedral is free, but pay for the Treasury — it's worth every euro.

**Soaking in Carolus Thermen at Night**
Floating in warm thermal water under the stars. The same springs the Romans discovered 2,000 years ago. Your muscles relax. The world slows down. This is Aachen's soul — a spa town for millennia, still healing people today.

**Biting Into Your First Printen**
Aachener Printen — spiced gingerbread that's been made here since the 1600s. Harder than regular gingerbread, flavored with spices brought back from the Crusades. Dipped in coffee or eaten plain. Every bakery makes them. It's Aachen in edible form — historic, spiced, enduring.

**Stumbling Upon Student Bars on a Thursday Night**
The historic center transforms. Students pack the bars and Kneipen. The international vibe (German, Belgian, Dutch students mixing) creates this unique energy. Aachen is old. But it's also young. That contradiction is its charm.

## ⛪ Aachen Cathedral — The Heart of Everything

![Aachen Cathedral](/images/aachen-cathedral.jpg)

This is why you come to Aachen. **Aachen Cathedral (Aachener Dom)** is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most important medieval structures in Europe.

### Why It's Extraordinary:

**Charlemagne's chapel:** Built around 790-800 AD as Charlemagne's palace chapel. He's buried here. This is the **oldest cathedral in northern Europe** still in use.

**The Octagon:** The central part of the cathedral — an eight-sided structure inspired by Byzantine architecture. It was revolutionary for its time. The engineering is stunning. Look up at the dome and try to imagine this being built 1,200+ years ago.

**The Throne:** Charlemagne's marble throne sits in the gallery. Between 936 and 1531, **thirty Holy Roman Emperors** were crowned here. You can see the throne (with a guided tour), but you can't sit on it. Only one person has sat on it in modern times — Napoleon (of course).

**The Gothic Choir:** Added in the 14th century. Towering stained glass windows that flood the space with light. Absolutely breathtaking.

**Charlemagne's tomb:** He's buried in the cathedral, though his exact location has changed over the centuries. His remains are in a golden shrine (the Karlsschrein) in the choir.

### Visiting the Cathedral:

**Admission:** FREE to enter the cathedral (donations welcome)

**Treasury (Domschatzkammer):** €6 — **ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT**. One of the richest ecclesiastical treasuries in Europe. Charlemagne's bust, priceless reliquaries, manuscripts, liturgical objects. Don't skip this.

**Guided tours:** €4, available in multiple languages, highly recommended to understand what you're seeing

**Tower tours:** Occasional special tours to climb the tower (check cathedral website)

**When to visit:** Early morning for fewer crowds and beautiful light. The cathedral gets busy but never overwhelms.

**Time needed:** 30-45 minutes for cathedral, 45 minutes for Treasury, longer if you take a guided tour

**Dress code:** This is an active place of worship. Dress respectfully (covered shoulders, no shorts).

### The Cathedral Treasury (Domschatzkammer) ⭐⭐⭐

![Aachen Cathedral Treasury (Domschatzkammer)](/images/aachen-cathedral-treasury.jpg)

This deserves its own mention. **Don't skip this.**

**What you'll see:**
- **Charlemagne's bust (1349):** Gold, jewels, holds part of his skull
- **Cross of Lothar (10th century):** Intricately decorated processional cross
- **Persephone sarcophagus:** Ancient Roman sarcophagus used for Charlemagne's burial
- **Reliquaries:** Containing supposed relics of saints (arm bones, fingers, cloth fragments)
- **Illuminated manuscripts:** Beautiful medieval books
- **Liturgical objects:** Chalices, textiles, vestments spanning centuries

**Why it's incredible:** The sheer concentration of historically and artistically significant objects. Some are 1,000+ years old. The craftsmanship is exquisite. This is medieval Europe's treasure chest.

## 👑 Charlemagne's Aachen — Following the Emperor's Footsteps

Aachen was Charlemagne's **favorite residence** and the de facto capital of his empire (which stretched from Spain to Hungary). He built his palace here because of the **thermal springs** — the guy loved a good bath.

### Aachen Town Hall (Rathaus) ⭐⭐

## 🛁 Aachen's Thermal Heritage — Spa Town Since Roman Times

Aachen sits on **30+ hot springs** that the Romans discovered in the 1st century AD. The water comes out at 74°C (165°F) — some of the hottest springs in central Europe.

**Why hot springs here?** Volcanic activity deep underground heats the water, which emerges full of minerals (sulfur, calcium, magnesium).

**Historical significance:** Romans built baths. Charlemagne chose Aachen partly for the baths. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 19th century, Aachen was a fashionable spa destination. Even Casanova visited!

### Carolus Thermen ⭐⭐⭐

![Carolus Thermen](/images/aachen-carolus-thermen.jpg)

Modern thermal spa complex using Aachen's ancient hot springs. This is the best place to experience Aachen's spa heritage yourself.

**Practical info:**

- **Textile vs. nude areas:** Some areas require swimsuits, sauna areas are nude (standard in German spa culture)

### Elisenbrunnen (Elise Fountain) ⭐

**What is it?** Built in 1827, housing a hot spring. The water comes out at 52°C and smells strongly of sulfur (rotten eggs).

**Should you drink it?** Locals do. Tourists dare each other. It's warm, smells bad, tastes mineral-y, and supposedly has health benefits. It's an experience.

**Location:** Right in the center near the Marktplatz

## 🍰 Aachener Printen — The Local Specialty

![Aachener Printen](/images/aachener-printen.jpg)

**Aachener Printen** are Aachen's most famous food export. Think gingerbread, but **harder, spicier, and better**.

### What Are They?

A type of Lebkuchen (gingerbread) made with honey, spices (cinnamon, anise, cloves, coriander), and no fat. They've been made in Aachen since at least 1601.

**The spices:** Brought back from the Crusades and along spice trade routes. Aachen's location made it a spice trading hub.

**The texture:** Harder than soft American gingerbread. Slightly chewy. Some are glazed with chocolate or sugar.

**When to eat them:** Year-round, but especially associated with Christmas. Locals dunk them in coffee or tea.

### Where to Buy:

**Nobis Printen:** The most famous bakery, since 1858. Their shop is in the center. Try the chocolate-covered ones.

**Café Van den Daele:** Historic café (since 1890) serving Printen with coffee in a beautiful traditional setting.

**Printen-Schmitz:** Another traditional maker. Lots of varieties.

## 🌍 Tri-Border Point (Dreiländereck) ⭐

Where **Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands meet**. About 6km from Aachen's center.

**What is it?** A monument marking the exact spot where three countries converge. You can literally stand in all three countries at once.

**Is it worth visiting?** It's more of a novelty than a major attraction. If you have a car or bike, it's a fun side trip. There's a viewing tower (paid) with views over the border region.

**How to get there:** Bus 14 or 44 from Aachen center (30 minutes), or bike/drive

**Reality check:** It's a tourist photo op. Cool concept, but don't go out of your way unless you're really into borders.

Aachen has a **Lindt chocolate factory** with a factory shop selling chocolates at discounted prices.

**What's there:** Discount Lindt products (slightly damaged packaging, seasonal overstock, etc.), plus regular retail items.

**Worth it?** If you love Lindt and want to stock up cheaply, yes. It's not a museum or tour (like Cologne's Lindt Museum) — just a shop.

**Location:** Süsterfeldstraße 130 (about 15 minutes from city center by bus/tram)

## 🎯 The Bottom Line on Aachen

Aachen doesn't scream for attention. It doesn't have Berlin's edge, Cologne's tourist buzz, or Frankfurt's skyline. What it has is something deeper: **legitimacy**.

This is where Charlemagne, the father of Europe, chose to build his capital. Where thirty emperors were crowned. Where the foundations of medieval Europe were laid. You're not looking at reconstructions or replicas — you're standing in Charlemagne's actual chapel, seeing his actual throne, walking streets he walked.

But Aachen isn't stuck in the past. It's a living city with 45,000 students giving it youthful energy. It's an international crossroads where three countries meet and multiple cultures blend. It's a spa town where people have been healing in thermal waters for 2,000 years and still do today.

It's **quiet** enough to feel intimate. **Historic** enough to feel significant. **Young** enough to feel alive. And **underrated** enough that you'll have room to breathe.

You can do Aachen as a day trip from Cologne — see the cathedral, walk the Marktplatz, taste some Printen, head back. But give it a weekend and you can dig deeper: soak in the thermal baths, follow Charlemagne's footsteps, explore student bars, visit the tri-border point, really feel the layers of history.

**My advice?** Don't rush Aachen. This isn't a city you conquer with a checklist. Let it unfold. Spend an hour in the cathedral. Sit in Marktplatz with coffee and Printen. Walk the quiet streets. Soak in Carolus Thermen. Talk to students in a bar. Let the weight of European history settle on you.

Aachen rewards patience. It's not flashy. But it's real. And in a world of overtouristed highlights, that's increasingly rare.
