# Frankfurt — Where Medieval Charm Meets Modern Skylines

*Your insider's guide to Germany's most underrated city*

---

Frankfurt gets a bad rap. "Just a business city." "Nothing but banks." "Skip it for somewhere prettier."

Here's the truth: Frankfurt is **fantastic** — if you know where to look.

Yes, it's Germany's financial capital. Yes, the skyline is dominated by glass towers (they call it "Mainhattan" for a reason). Yes, business travelers outnumber tourists. But that's exactly what makes Frankfurt special. This is a **real**, **working** German city that happens to have incredible history, beautiful riverside culture, and some of the best food scenes in the country.

You step into the Altstadt and you're surrounded by half-timbered medieval buildings around Römerberg square. Walk ten minutes and you're standing under soaring skyscrapers. Cross the Main River and you're in Sachsenhausen drinking apple wine in a 300-year-old tavern. It's jarring. It's fascinating. It's very Frankfurt.

This is Germany's most diverse city — over 180 nationalities, the busiest airport, the European Central Bank, and somehow still a **laid-back, walkable city** where locals actually engage with their neighborhoods. Beer gardens fill with after-work crowds. The Main River promenade buzzes with people. Markets thrive. Street cafés spill onto sidewalks.

Frankfurt was 80% destroyed in WWII, so they rebuilt — some historic, some modern, creating this unique blend of old and new. It's not picture-perfect like Heidelberg. But it's authentic, livable, and way more interesting than it gets credit for.

Here's everything you need to know.

## ✨ The Frankfurt Moments That'll Stay With You

**Standing in Römerberg Square at Sunset**
You're surrounded by colorful half-timbered buildings that look straight out of a fairy tale. Tourists are taking photos. Locals are having a beer at outdoor tables. Then you turn around and see modern skyscrapers looming in the background. Medieval meets modern. That's Frankfurt in one image.

**Walking Along the Main River on a Summer Evening**
The promenade is packed. People jogging, cycling, walking dogs. Groups drinking wine on the grass. Boat restaurants bobbing in the water. The skyline glittering across the river. This is where Frankfurt lives — outside, by the water, together.

**Your First Apfelwein in Sachsenhausen**
Sitting in a traditional apple wine tavern, the waiter brings you a Bembel (traditional jug) of Apfelwein. It's tart, refreshing, served in a ribbed glass. This is Frankfurt's drink — not beer, not wine, but apple wine. It's been made here for 250+ years and locals are fiercely proud of it.

**MyZeil's Architecture Blowing Your Mind**
You walk into what you think is just another shopping mall and suddenly you're inside this futuristic glass canyon with a spiraling vortex ceiling. It's like stepping into a sci-fi movie. This is Frankfurt showing off — we can do medieval charm AND cutting-edge architecture.

**Kleinmarkthalle on a Saturday Morning**
The smells hit you first — fresh bread, cheese, flowers, coffee. The market is packed with locals shopping for their weekly groceries. This isn't a tourist market — this is where Frankfurt actually shops. And the food? Incredible.

## 🏛️ The Altstadt — Frankfurt's Historic Heart

Frankfurt's Old Town was almost completely destroyed in WWII. They rebuilt parts of it, creating this fascinating mix of authentic medieval structures, reconstructions, and modern buildings.

### Römerberg Square ⭐⭐⭐

![Frankfurt Römerberg](/images/frankfurt-romerberg.jpg)

The postcard-perfect heart of Frankfurt. Half-timbered houses with colorful facades surround the square. This is the Frankfurt everyone pictures.

**The Römer** — Frankfurt's city hall since 1405. The stepped gables are iconic. Inside, the Kaisersaal (Emperor's Hall) has portraits of 52 Holy Roman Emperors.

**The vibe:** It's beautiful, it's touristy, and it's completely rebuilt (bombed in WWII, reconstructed in the 1980s). But it works. Sit at an outdoor café, have a beer, people-watch. This is the starting point for understanding Frankfurt.

**When to visit:** Early morning for photos without crowds, or evening when everything's lit up. The Christmas market here (November-December) is magical.

### Frankfurt Cathedral (Kaiserdom) ⭐⭐

![Frankfurt Cathedral (Kaiserdom)](/images/frankfurt-cathederal.jpg)

Gothic cathedral where Holy Roman Emperors were elected and crowned for 300 years. Survived WWII bombs (barely). The tower offers great views of the city (95m climb).

**Worth it?** If you're into cathedrals or want the view, yes. Otherwise, admire from outside.

### Eiserner Steg (Iron Footbridge) ⭐⭐

![Eiserner Steg (Iron Footbridge](/images/frankfurt-eiserner-steg.jpg)

Pedestrian bridge across the Main River connecting the Altstadt to Sachsenhausen. Covered in love locks (of course). Great views of the skyline.

**Do this:** Walk across at sunset. The light on the river and skyline is beautiful.

### New Altstadt (Neue Altstadt)

Controversial modern reconstruction project — they rebuilt 35 buildings in medieval style on the site of the old town destroyed in WWII. Opened in 2018.

**The debate:** Purists hate it (fake history!). Others love it (brings back the old character!). It's undeniably impressive and feels surprisingly authentic.

**Highlights:** Hühnermarkt (Chicken Market) plaza, narrow medieval lanes, beautiful facades

---

## 🏙️ Modern Frankfurt — Mainhattan's Gleaming Side

Frankfurt is nicknamed "Mainhattan" because of its skyline — Germany's only true skyline, actually. The contrast with the Altstadt is striking.

### MyZeil Shopping Mall ⭐⭐

![Frankfurt MyZeil](/images/frankfurt-myzeil1.jpg)
![Frankfurt MyZeil](/images/frankfurt-myzeil2.jpg)

Forget what you think about shopping malls. MyZeil's architecture is **stunning** — a futuristic glass structure with a spiraling vortex-like interior canyon. It looks like something from Blade Runner.

**Why visit:** The architecture alone is worth it. The shopping is standard international brands, but the building is spectacular. The upper levels have great views down into the vortex.

**Where:** On the Zeil (Frankfurt's main shopping street) near Konstablerwache

### Hauptwache ⭐

![Frankfurt Hauptwache](/images/frankfurt-hauptwache.jpg)

The absolute center of Frankfurt. A baroque building (former guardhouse from 1730) surrounded by modern buildings and the U-Bahn station below.

**The scene:** Always crowded. Street performers. Meeting point for locals. Outdoor cafés. This is Frankfurt's living room.

**What's nearby:** Zeil shopping street, Kleinmarkthalle market, Konstablerwache

### Konstablerwache

Historic square and major transit hub. The Konstablerwache building (1825) sits among modern architecture.

**Why it matters:** This is where Frankfurt pulses. Farmers market on Thursdays and Saturdays. Always busy. Very local.

### Main Tower (Eschenheimer Turm)⭐⭐

![Frankfurt Main Tower (Eschenheimer Turm)](/images/frankfurt-eschenheimer-turm.jpg)

One of Frankfurt's tallest buildings (200m) with an observation deck on the 56th floor.

**The view:** 360° panorama of Frankfurt and the region. The only publicly accessible skyscraper observation deck in Germany.

**Worth it?** €9 admission, but the views are spectacular. Go at sunset if possible.

**Pro tip:** The viewing platform is outdoors (partly) — dress warm in winter!

### Banking District

![Frankfurt Banking District](/images/frankfurt-banking-district.jpg)

The glass and steel towers housing Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, European Central Bank, and countless financial firms.

**Is it worth visiting?** As a tourist? Not really. But walking through gives you context for Frankfurt's role as Europe's financial heart. The contrast with the Altstadt is the point.

## 🌊 The Main River — Frankfurt's Social Heart

The Main River cuts through Frankfurt, and the riverbanks are where the city lives.

### Main River Promenade ⭐⭐⭐

![Frankfurt Main River Promenade](/images/frankfurt-main-river-promenade.jpg)

The walkway along both sides of the river. On nice days (and Frankfurt has surprisingly nice weather!), this is packed.

**What you'll see:**
- Joggers and cyclists
- People lounging on the grass
- Groups drinking wine and beer (it's allowed!)
- Boat restaurants and bars
- Beautiful skyline views
- Street performers

**Do this:** Walk from Eiserner Steg to Alte Brücke (about 2km). Stop at a riverside café. Watch the sunset over the skyline. This is Frankfurt at its best.

### Boat Restaurants & River Cruises ⭐⭐

![Frankfurt Boat Restaurants & River Cruises](/images/frankfurt-boat-restaurant.jpg)

Permanently moored boats converted into restaurants and bars line the river.

**Why they're great:** Unique atmosphere, beautiful river views, solid food. Perfect for dinner on a summer evening.

**River cruises:** Various companies offer Main River cruises (1-2 hours). Nice way to see the city from the water, but the riverbank walk is honestly just as good and free.

### Sachsenhausen Side

The south bank of the Main. Less skyscraper views, more residential and charming. This side has the apple wine taverns and a more local feel.

---

## 🍎 Sachsenhausen — Apple Wine Country

Cross the river to Sachsenhausen and you enter Frankfurt's traditional heart. This is where locals go for **Apfelwein** (apple wine) in traditional taverns.

### What Is Apfelwein? ⭐⭐⭐

![Frankfurt Apfelwein](/images/frankfurter-apfelwein.jpg)

Frankfurt's signature drink. Tart, alcoholic apple cider served in special ribbed glasses from a traditional ceramic jug (Bembel). It's been made here for 250+ years.

**The taste:** Tart, dry, refreshing. Not sweet like American cider. Takes some getting used to, but locals love it.

**How it's served:** In a Bembel (jug) that serves multiple glasses. Poured into Geripptes (ribbed glasses). Often mixed with lemonade (Süßgespritzter) or soda water (Sauergespritzter) if you want it less intense.

### Traditional Apple Wine Taverns:

**Adolf Wagner** ⭐⭐⭐ — The most famous. Always packed. Traditional food, lively atmosphere, tourists and locals mixed.

**Atschel** — More local, less touristy. Great traditional Frankfurt food.

**Dauth-Schneider** — Big outdoor garden, family-friendly, good for first-timers.

**Apfelwein Solzer** — Cozy, old-school, authentic.

**What to eat with Apfelwein:**
- **Handkäse mit Musik** — Sour milk cheese with onions ("mit Musik" = "with music" because... it makes you gassy)
- **Grüne Soße** — Frankfurt's famous green herb sauce served with boiled eggs and potatoes
- **Rippchen** — Cured pork ribs
- **Frankfurter Kranz** — Local cake (buttercream, nuts, cherries)

**The vibe:** Wooden benches, shared tables, loud and social. This is community dining. Don't expect fancy — expect authentic.

---

## 🍽️ Frankfurt Food Scene

Frankfurt's food scene is excellent and surprisingly diverse.

### Traditional Frankfurt Specialties:

**Grüne Soße (Green Sauce)** ⭐⭐⭐ — Frankfurt's most famous dish. Seven herbs blended with sour cream and spices, served cold with boiled eggs and potatoes. Sounds boring, tastes incredible. There's a Grüne Soße Festival every year.

**Frankfurter Würstchen** — Small, thin pork sausages. These are the ORIGINAL "hot dogs" (Frankfurt claims to have invented them).

**Bethmännchen** — Marzipan cookies with almond halves. Traditional Christmas treat but available year-round.

**Frankfurter Kranz** — Ring-shaped cake with buttercream, rum, and cherries. Very Frankfurt.

### Kleinmarkthalle ⭐⭐⭐

![Frankfurt Kleinmarkthalle](/images/frankfurt-kleinmarkthalle.jpg)

Indoor market that's an absolute must-visit. This is where locals shop — fresh produce, meats, cheeses, flowers, baked goods, international foods.

**What to do:**

- Get breakfast (coffee and pastries)
- Buy cheese and charcuterie

## 🎯 The Bottom Line on Frankfurt

Frankfurt gets dismissed as "just a business city," and that's exactly why it's underrated. This is **real Germany** — a working city that happens to have incredible history, culture, and livability.

Yes, it has skyscrapers. Yes, it's financial. But it also has:
- A beautifully rebuilt Altstadt with medieval charm
- A thriving Main River promenade where the whole city hangs out
- Traditional apple wine culture that's been around for 250+ years
- World-class museums and art
- Incredible diversity and international food
- A walkable, livable city that actually functions

The contrast is the point. Medieval half-timbered houses next to glass towers. Traditional apple wine taverns in the shadow of the European Central Bank. History and modernity coexisting, not fighting.

Frankfurt won't blow your mind with picture-perfect beauty like Heidelberg or Rothenburg. But it'll show you authentic, modern Germany — a city where people actually live and work, not just a museum piece preserved for tourists.

**My advice?** Give Frankfurt a chance. Walk the Main River promenade. Explore Römerberg. Drink Apfelwein in Sachsenhausen. Browse Kleinmarkthalle. Marvel at MyZeil's architecture. Sit in a beer garden. See the skyline at sunset.

Frankfurt rewards curiosity. Look past the banking towers and you'll find a city with soul, history, and a quality of life that makes it one of Germany's most livable cities.
