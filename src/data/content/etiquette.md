# Cultural Etiquette

Understanding German social norms will help you avoid awkward situations and build better relationships. Here's what you need to know to blend in.

## Greetings & Social Interactions

### The Handshake

**When to Shake Hands:**
- Meeting someone for the first time
- Business meetings
- Saying goodbye after spending time together
- Seeing someone you haven't seen in a while

**How to Do It Right:**
- Firm grip (not bone-crushing)
- Eye contact
- Brief (2-3 seconds)
- Say your name clearly

**When NOT to Shake Hands:**
- Entering a shop or restaurant
- Passing someone on the street
- If someone is eating
- If your hands are dirty/wet

### Greeting in Public

**DO:**
- Say "Guten Tag" when entering small shops
- Nod or brief "Hallo" to neighbors
- Greet people you pass on hiking trails
- Say goodbye when leaving shops ("Tschüss" or "Auf Wiedersehen")

**DON'T:**
- Start conversations with strangers on public transport (unless emergency)
- Ask "How are you?" unless you genuinely want to know
- Wave enthusiastically at strangers
- Talk loudly on your phone in public

### Personal Space

**Important Rules:**
- Germans value personal space (arm's length)
- Don't stand too close in line
- Avoid physical touch with acquaintances
- Hugging is reserved for close friends
- No kissing on cheeks (unless very close or specific regions)

## Punctuality is Sacred

### The Golden Rule: Be On Time

**What "On Time" Means:**
- 10:00 meeting = arrive at 10:00, not 10:05
- Dinner invitation at 19:00 = arrive at 19:00-19:05
- Being 5+ minutes late = call ahead
- Being 15+ minutes late = very rude

**Academic Quarter Exception:**
- "c.t." (cum tempore) = 15 minutes late is expected
- "s.t." (sine tempore) = be exactly on time
- Mostly for university lectures

**If You're Running Late:**
- Call or text immediately
- Give new estimated arrival time
- Apologize when you arrive
- Don't make excuses (traffic is not an excuse - you should have planned better)

**Pro Tip:** Set your watch 5 minutes fast if you struggle with punctuality.

## Communication Style

### Direct & Honest

**Germans are DIRECT:**
- They say what they mean
- No "sugar coating"
- "No" means no (not "maybe")
- Criticism is meant to be helpful, not personal
- Silence means they're thinking, not angry

**Examples:**
- ❌ American: "This is interesting, but maybe we could consider..."
- ✅ German: "That won't work. We should do it this way."

**This Doesn't Mean Rude:**
- They're not being mean
- It's culturally efficient and clear
- Don't take it personally
- Appreciate the honesty

### "Sie" vs. "du"

**Sie (Formal "You"):**
- Use with: strangers, older people, authority figures, coworkers (initially)
- Shows respect
- Always safe to start here

**du (Informal "You"):**
- Use with: friends, children, close colleagues
- Wait for the German person to offer "du"
- Usually happens after knowing someone for weeks/months
- Switching to "du" is a milestone (often celebrated with a drink)

**The Offer:**
- Older/higher-status person offers first
- "Wir können uns duzen" (We can use "du")
- Sometimes sealed with a toast
- Once you switch, you can't go back

### Small Talk is Not a Thing

**What Germans DON'T Do:**
