- Grab a slice of **Pizza al Taglio** (pizza by the slice) for a quick, authentic lunch.
- Indulge in **Gelato** from a quality shop (look for natural, muted colors).

## Local culture
- The concept of "la dolce vita" (the sweet life) embodies the relaxed, convivial pace of life.
- Romans eat dinner late, usually starting around 8:30 pm.
- Always check the opening times of churches and museums, as they can vary widely.
