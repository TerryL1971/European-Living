Moving to Germany means paperwork — and registering your address (“Anmeldung”) is your first official step toward settling in.

---

## Why It Matters
Every resident in Germany must register their home address at the local Bürgeramt within 14 days of moving in. This registration is essential for:
- Getting a tax ID (Steuer-ID)
- Opening a bank account
- Signing up for health insurance
- Signing contracts like mobile or internet plans

---

## What You’ll Need
- Valid passport or residence permit  
- Rental contract or confirmation letter from your landlord (Wohnungsgeberbestätigung)  
- Completed registration form (Anmeldeformular)

---

## How to Do It
1. Find your local Bürgeramt or Rathaus.  
2. Book an appointment online if possible — they fill up fast!  
3. Bring your documents and fill out the form at the counter.  
4. Receive your registration certificate (Meldebescheinigung).

## Helpful Tips
- Always keep the Meldebescheinigung — you’ll need it often.  
- If you move again, you must re-register within 14 days.  
- Some offices allow online pre-registration forms.
