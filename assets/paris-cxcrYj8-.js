*Your insider's guide to the world's most romantic city*

---

Paris is everything you've heard and more. I've visited multiple times, and each trip reveals new layers to this magnificent city. Yes, it's touristy. Yes, it can be expensive. But there's a reason Paris is the world's most visited city — it's absolutely magical.

## 🗼 Start with the Eiffel Tower

![Paris Eiffel Tower](/images/paris-eiffel.jpg)

Let's be honest — you're going to see the **Eiffel Tower**, so let's do it right.

### Best Ways to Experience It:

**From Below (Free)**
- Walk through Champ de Mars gardens
- Best views from Trocadéro across the river
- Stunning at night when it sparkles (every hour on the hour)

**Going Up (Book Ahead)**
- Tickets sell out weeks in advance
- Second floor has the best views (top can be cloudy)
- Sunset timing is magical but crowded

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Skip the tourist trap restaurants at the base. Instead, grab a baguette, cheese, and wine from a nearby shop and picnic on the Champ de Mars with the tower as your backdrop. That's the real Parisian experience.

**My Take:** The Eiffel Tower is touristy, but it's iconic for a reason. See it at night when it sparkles — that's when the magic really happens.

## 🎨 The Louvre — More Than the Mona Lisa

The **Louvre** is the world's largest art museum, and you cannot see it all in one visit. Don't even try.

### What You Must See:

**The Big Three:**
- **Mona Lisa** — Yes, it's small and crowded, but you have to see it
- **Venus de Milo** — Greek sculpture perfection
- **Winged Victory of Samothrace** — At the top of the stairs, breathtaking

**Beyond the Highlights:**
- Egyptian antiquities
- French paintings (David, Delacroix)
- Islamic art wing (often empty, absolutely stunning)
- The building itself is a former royal palace

### Louvre Survival Guide:

> **🎟️ Buy Tickets Online:** Skip the 2-hour line
> 
> **⏰ Go Early or Late:** Opens at 9am, least crowded before 11am or after 3pm
> 
> **🚪 Use the Carrousel Entrance:** Underground, much shorter line
> 
> **📱 Louvre App:** Download it for navigation (this place is HUGE)
> 
> **⏱️ Time Needed:** 3-4 hours minimum, full day if you love art

**Reality Check:** The Louvre is overwhelming. Pick 2-3 sections, see them properly, and come back another time. You'll enjoy it more than trying to sprint through everything.

## 🥐 Parisian Café Culture

One of Paris's greatest pleasures is sitting at a sidewalk café, sipping coffee, and watching the world go by.

### How to Do It Right:

**The Rules:**
- Sit outside (even if it's chilly — people-watching is the point)
- Order a **café crème** or **café au lait**
- Don't rush — you're paying for the experience, not just the coffee
- The waiter won't bring the check until you ask for it ("L'addition, s'il vous plaît")

**Where to Go:**
- **Café de Flore** — Historic, literary famous, touristy but iconic
- **Les Deux Magots** — Next to Café de Flore, equally famous
- **Any neighborhood café** — Honestly, pick any local spot with a good vibe

> *"Café culture in Paris isn't about the coffee quality (though it's good). It's about slowing down, observing, and feeling like a Parisian for an hour."*

## ⚠️ Paris Reality Check

Let's be honest about Paris:

### The Good:

### The Challenging:

❌ It's expensive
