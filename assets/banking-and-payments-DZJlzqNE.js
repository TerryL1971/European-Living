Germany’s banking system is reliable and modern — but a little different from what most Americans are used to.

## Opening a Bank Account
To open a local account, you’ll need:
- Passport or residence permit  
- Proof of address (Meldebescheinigung)  
- Proof of employment or income (sometimes)

Popular banks include N26, Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, and Sparkasse.

## Payment Basics
- Cash is still common, especially in smaller towns.  
- Debit cards (EC or Girocards) are used for everyday purchases.  
- Credit cards are accepted in larger stores, hotels, and restaurants.

## Online & Mobile Banking
Modern fintechs like N26 or Revolut offer easy account setup in English and integrate with Apple Pay and Google Pay.

---

## Money Transfers
- **SEPA transfers**: Used across Europe for free or low-cost transfers.  
- **Wise (TransferWise)**: Great for U.S.–EU money transfers.
