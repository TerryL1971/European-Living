Amsterdam is unlike anywhere else in Europe. I've visited several times, and each trip reveals new sides to this fascinating city. Yes, it's famous for its liberal policies, but there's so much more — world-class museums, stunning canal architecture, incredible cycling culture, and some of the friendliest people you'll meet.

## 🚲 First Things First: Bikes Rule Here

Amsterdam is the world's most bike-friendly city, and bicycles have **absolute right of way**.

### As a Pedestrian:

> ⚠️ **NEVER walk in bike lanes!** They're marked with red/brick pavement
> 
> **Look both ways** before crossing — bikes are fast and silent
> 
> **Listen for bells** — that's your warning to move
> 
> **Stay alert** — bikes come from everywhere

### Rent a Bike?

**Pros:**
- Best way to see the city like a local
- Amsterdam is completely flat
- Bike lanes everywhere
- It's genuinely fun

**Cons:**
- Chaotic if you're not used to cycling in traffic
- Bike theft is common (use good locks)
- Learning the unwritten rules takes time

> **💡 My Take:** If you're a confident cyclist, rent a bike for a day. If not, walking and trams work great. Don't feel pressured to cycle if you're not comfortable.
