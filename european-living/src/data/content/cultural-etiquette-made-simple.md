# Cultural Etiquette Made Simple

Understanding local habits helps you fit in faster — and Germans appreciate politeness and punctuality.

---

## Greetings & Formality
- Start with **“Guten Tag”** or **“Hallo.”**  
- Use **Herr** (Mr.) and **Frau** (Mrs.) with last names unless invited otherwise.  
- Handshakes are common — firm, brief, and always make eye contact.

---

## Everyday Etiquette
- Always be on time — punctuality is respect.  
- Quiet hours (Ruhezeiten) are taken seriously.  
- Recycle correctly — bins are color-coded!

---

## Dining & Tipping
- Keep both hands visible at the table.  
- Say **“Guten Appetit”** before eating.  
- Tip 5–10% directly to the waiter; don’t leave money on the table.

---

## Small Talk & Communication
- Germans value direct, honest communication.  
- Avoid overly personal topics until you know someone well.  
- Don’t confuse directness with rudeness — it’s cultural clarity.
